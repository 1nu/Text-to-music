Text to Music

contributors:

Initally as a way to learn ruby, this converts test input to a stream of messages for PureData to read and sonify. Currently it asks for a speed, then an empty text prompt. Which is then converted into audio.

To use:
 Open ruby_interact.pd in puredata
 Open manual_input.rb in ruby

Future intent:
 Stream twitter messages with a given search term, sonify in real time.
 Connect to Pidgin or IRC, musical chat client.
