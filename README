Requires:
  git 
  ruby
  rubygems 
  openssl-lib
  Pure Data Extended (from www.puredata.info)
Gems:
  tweetstream (sudo gem install tweetstream)

For manual import:
  Open ruby_interact.pd in puredata
  Open manual_input.rb in ruby (e.g. ruby manual_input.rb)
  Follow on-screen prompts
 

For twitter stream sonification:
  Open ruby_interact.pd in puredata
  ruby twitter.rb
  Input a twitter username and password when requested
  Watch the tweets contining 'fail' rolling in and being sonified
  To stop script press ctrl+c (you may have to hold this for a while to get through the queue of tweets)
  Optionally:
    Modify the first few lines of twitter.rb to remove the need to type a username or to change the default search
    use arguments to change the searched for terms (e.g. ruby twitter.rb win or ruby twitter.rb lemmy bieber)

Likely errors:
  `initialize': Connection refused - connect(2) (Errno::ECONNREFUSED) - means that ruby_interact.pd is not open (it opens a TCP port to listen to the Character class)

Future intent:
 Connect to Pidgin or IRC, musical chat client.
